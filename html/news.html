                The Bizarre Adventure Has Returned as it has been reported that acclaimed
                author Hirohiko Araki confirmed the first teaser of the next part of the
                bizarre adventure aptly named Jojolands. It is unknown at the moment, when Jojolands will be released.
                We will keep you updated upon it.

                At the same time, the end of the animated series was aired no less than three months ago! 
                Sources suggest that this may be the last of the animated series. Although for the time being there
                has been no real report on the status of the next part, Steel Ball Run.

                The end of the semester has arrived, and with it the people all their much needed
                rest. But the time is not over yet there is more things to do. And more things to 
                finish. Even subjects that seemed finish surprises students as they in fact have
                activities that they need to finish before it's all over. It's all a race towards the finishing
                of requirements. May all students survive in this more so grueling atmosphere!
