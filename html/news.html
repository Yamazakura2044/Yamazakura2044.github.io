                At the same time, the end of the animated series was aired no less than three months ago! 
                Sources suggest that this may be the last of the animated series. Although for the time being there
                has been no real report on the status of the next part, Steel Ball Run.

                The end of the semester has arrived, and with it the people all their much needed
                rest. But the time is not over yet there is more things to do. And more things to 
                finish. Even subjects that seemed finish surprises students as they in fact have
                activities that they need to finish before it's all over. It's all a race towards the finishing
                of requirements. May all students survive in this more so grueling atmosphere!

                "There was a time in my life where I thought "Wow, maybe this really is the path for me." Day by day I think of regret whenever I speak those lines.
                I truly was not prepared for this, nothing in my years in highschool prepared me for what was to come. They were all insane in the head, thinking back now.

                    "I remember fondly when we finished our finals, how the feeling amongst my classmates were not a real sense of relief that it's over, but the dread knowing that it was not.
                    I sympathize with them really, most of their families worked hard to get them to where they are now. It's immense pressure trying to live up to something you know you're not.

                    "I've never been more stressed in my entire life. I definitely underestimated college to the highest degree. After all, I came here expecting to be all high and mighty like I always
                    was back in highschool. But it was different this time. I was not able to handle it as much as I could. I found my limit, academically, and passionately. I've noticed people that could
                    do what I can, but better, more accomplished and. I don't know, it broke me. I guess. After all, what am I if not the things that I frequently prided myself for. Hopefully by this break
                    and by next sem, I'd figure myself out." - Anonymous
